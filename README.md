IT Intern | High School Senior | Studying Comp Sci

I'm a high school student with a strong interest in computer science, particularly in coding, software development, and cybersecurity. My journey in technology began with a simple curiosity about how things work, which quickly evolved into a passion for creating solutions and building projects that make an impact.

I’ve taken courses in AP Computer Science A, Honors Cybersecurity, and AP Computer Science Principles and have hands-on experience with programming languages such as Python, Java, and HTML/CSS. In addition to my coursework, I enjoy participating in FIRST Robotics competitions and hackathons, where I’ve honed my problem-solving skills and collaborated with others to bring ideas to life.

My goal is to pursue a career in computer science, where I can continue to explore new technologies and contribute to innovative projects. I'm always eager to connect with professionals in the field, learn from their experiences, and explore opportunities for internships or mentorship that will help me grow in my journey.
